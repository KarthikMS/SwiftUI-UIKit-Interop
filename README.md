# SwiftUI-UIKit-Interop

A simple project demonstrating how to slowly incorporate SwiftUI into your existing UIKit project. With SwiftUI, it is possible to replace UIViewController with a SwiftUI View, one at a time, just like Swift-ObjectiveC interoperability.

In this project, setting appConfig.uiRenderingFramework to `swiftUI` uses SwiftUI, while `uiKit` uses UIKit.
